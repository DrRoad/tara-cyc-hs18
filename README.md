# tara-cyc-hs18

TaraCyc contains the first ever large-scale mapping of viral metabolomics data collected from ocean environments around the world. The Tara Oceans Project travelled worldwide collecting water samples for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. This genomic data has been mapped to metabolomic pathways. Recently, viruses have been shown to encode proteins that interact with host metabolic pathways in ways not previously explored, such as the BLANK virus that promoted photosynthetic activity in the cayanobacteria that it infects in order to promote cellular growth and support viral dissemination (REFEReNCE).

The TaraCyc website contains all of this analysed metaviriome data with an interactive, user-friendly interface. The website can be accessed at: LINK.
