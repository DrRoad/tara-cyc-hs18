Decided to use Shiny

Samples taken from around the world
Filtered to isolate viral component
Underwent metagenomic sequencing
Mapped reads to pathways - get mapping of pathways in different areas of ocean
rpkm (reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) - normalized count of how many reads mapped to a transcript -  values - value of expression level of a pathway
5 different depths for sampling - in meters
lat long

Mapping of metagenomic data:
